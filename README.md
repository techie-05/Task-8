Project Title: K-Means Clustering and Evaluation

Overview
This project illustrates the methodology of clustering a dataset through K-Means, determining the ideal number of clusters via the Elbow Method, and assessing the clustering performance with the Silhouette Score. The dataset is imported, optionally reduced to two dimensions using PCA for enhanced visualization, and clustered with color-coded plots to facilitate interpretation.

Goals Achieved

- Imported the dataset and visualized its structure
- Utilized PCA (optional) to convert data for 2D visualization
- Executed K-Means clustering and allocated labels to data points
- Identified the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- Illustrated the clusters with color-coded plots for improved comprehension
- Assessed clustering efficiency using the Silhouette Score

Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

1. Imported the dataset using pandas
2. Utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction (optional)
3. Executed K-Means clustering with various K values
4. Employed the Elbow Method to ascertain the best K
5. Allocated cluster labels and visualized the outcomes
6. Computed the Silhouette Score for evaluation

Visualization
The dataset is depicted with color-coded cluster assignments, ensuring distinct separation of groups. If PCA is utilized, the clusters are illustrated in a 2D space, simplifying the interpretation of patterns.
